    <p> <b>Some of the advantages of IoT include the following:</b> </p>

   <p> ability to access information from anywhere at any time on any device;
    improved communication between connected electronic devices;
    transferring data packets over a connected network saving time and money; and
    automating tasks helping to improve the quality of a business's services and reducing the need for human intervention. </p>
    <p> <b> Some disadvantages of IoT include the following:</b> </p>
    
   <p> As the number of connected devices increases and more information is shared between devices, the potential that a hacker could steal confidential information also increases.
    Enterprises may eventually have to deal with massive numbers -- maybe even millions -- of IoT devices, and collecting and managing the data from all those devices will be challenging.
    If there's a bug in the system, it's likely that every connected device will become corrupted.
    Since there's no international standard of compatibility for IoT, it's difficult for devices from different manufacturers to communicate with each other.</p>
